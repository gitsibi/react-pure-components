The "PureCounterComponent" performs better than the "SimpleCounterComponent" in terms of rendering efficiency.This is because 
"PureComponent" implements a shallow comparison on state and props, which helps prevent unnecessary re-renders. If the state or props do 
not change, "PureComponent" will not re-render, whereas "Component" will re-render regardless of whether the state or props have actually 
changed.This optimization can lead to better performance, especially in larger applications where re-renders can be expensive.
